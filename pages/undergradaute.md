## Certificate in Secular Jewish Studies
Our Certificate in Securlar Jewish Studies program highlights the secular, non-religious sphere of Jewish experience and Jews in America. Temple's Certificate in Secular Jewish Studies is open to all students interested in Jewish Studies. The program is a mini-minor on secular expressions of Jewishness in culture, politics, literature, history, art, film and philosophy. Jewish secularism is rarely approached as an individual subject, and few institutions devote the academic rigor and resources to it that Temple University does. If you work toward the certificate, you'll take courses that introduce you to the history of Jewish secular traditions and the history of the concept of secular space and political traditions in Western society. Some students also complete an internships or externship or in local Jewish organizations. 

The Certificate in Jewish Secular Studies was introduced in 2006 and is the first of its kind in the nation.
