## Certificate In Secular Jewish Studies
The Certificate in Jewish Secular Studies was introduced in 2006 and is the first of its kind in the nation. This program highlights the secular, non-religious sphere of Jewish experience and Jews in America. It questions whether Judaism can accurately be called a religion, considers conceptual issues about the rise of Jewish secular traditions in the modern world, and raises provocative questions about the role of religion in public space. The certificate is a vibrant way in to Jewish Studies, and can be completed in five content courses, with no language requirements. This program has been designed with student interest and ease in mind. Students who are already majoring or minoring in Jewish Studies, students in other CLA majors, and students from any program or school at Temple who want to do this mini-minor on secular expressions of Jewishness, culture, politics, literature, history, art, film, philosophy are welcome.

## Plan Of Study
For the Certificate, students need to complete at least one of the core courses, Jewish Secularism/Jewish Civilization I and II. These courses introduce students to the history of Jewish secular traditions and to the history of the concept of secular space and secular political traditions in Western Society. In addition, students take either 3 of 4 electives, drawn from the Jewish Studies offerings. These electives may include an internship in local Jewish organizations, and an internship elective may be completed during Summer semester. The [Temple Bulletin](http://bulletin.temple.edu/undergraduate/liberal-arts/jewish-studies/) lists the specific offerings of the Certificate.

## Jewish Studies Internships
The Jewish Studies Internship course engages students trough a hands-on experience with Jewish cultural, historical, communial or religious organizations in Philadelphia's vibrant Jewish community. You'll work with the Director of Jewish Studies to develop an appropriate set of readings and complete a research project based on a compelling aspect of the work of the organizations. 

## Study Abroad in Israel

Not only is Israel a country with unrivaled religious, cultural and political significance, it is also the second most educated country in the world. Israel is one of the most common countries that students travel to as a part of study abroad program. In addition to Israel, Jewish Studies majors travel to almost every country for study abroad programs through Temple University's external programs and exchanges.
