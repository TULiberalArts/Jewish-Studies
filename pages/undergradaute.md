## BA in Jewish Studies
Our BA in Jewish Studies program emphasizes intellectual, analytical, communication and interpersonal skills - essential for success in any career. If you join us, you will explore contemporary issues of Jewish culture, identity and practice through the topics of immigration, gender, religious practice, artistic expression, politics and more. The major in Jewish Studies is offered through the [College of Liberal Arts](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/) and offers students a broad but rigorous education in the humanities and social sciences.

## Minor in Jewish Studies
If you major in another subject, minoring in Jewish Studies adds an interdisciplinary depth to your undergraduate education. Our minor allows students majoring in business, the sciences, engineering, government or other CLA majors to present an exceptional academic background to prospective employers and graduate schools. Whether you concentrate on the American Jewish experience, ancient Jeruslalem or the the role of women in Jewish life, you can tailor your minor to suit your interests.

## Certificate in Secular Jewish Studies
Over the past two decades, the number of American Jews who define themselves as secular has almost doubled. Our Certificate in Secular Jewish Studies program is the first of its kind and highlights the secular, non-religious sphere of Jewish experience. A mini-minor on expressions of Jewishness in everything from politics to the arts, you'll take courses that introduce you to the history and concept of secular space and traditions in Western culture. Jewish secularism is rarely approached as an individual subject, and few institutions devote the academic rigor and resources to it that Temple University does.

The Jewish Studies Internship course engages students trough hands-on experience with cultural, historical or religious Jewish organizations in Philadelphia's vibrant Jewish community. You'll work with the Director of Jewish Studies to develop an appropriate set of readings and complete a research project based on your internship experience.
