## Certificate in Secular Jewish Studies
Temple's Certificate in Secular Jewish Studies is open to all students interested in Jewish Studies. While many colleges and universities offer majors, minors and graduate degrees in Jewish Studies, Temple's certificate program is the first of its kind. Jewish secularism is rarely approached as an individual subject, and few institutions devote the academic rigor and resources to it that Temple University does. If you work toward the certificate, you'll take courses that introduce you to the history of Jewish secular traditions and the history of the concept of secular space and political traditions in Western society. Some students also complete an interships or externships or in local Jewish organizations. 


The Certificate in Jewish Secular Studies was introduced in 2006 and is the first of its kind in the nation. This program highlights the secular, non-religious sphere of Jewish experience and Jews in America. It questions whether Judaism can accurately be called a religion, considers conceptual issues about the rise of Jewish secular traditions in the modern world, and raises provocative questions about the role of religion in public space. The certificate is a vibrant way in to Jewish Studies, and can be completed in five content courses, with no language requirements. This program has been designed with student interest and ease in mind. Students who are already majoring or minoring in Jewish Studies, students in other CLA majors, and students from any program or school at Temple who want to do this mini-minor on secular expressions of Jewishness, culture, politics, literature, history, art, film, philosophy are welcome.
