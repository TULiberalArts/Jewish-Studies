## Examine Jewish History, Culture and Practice in Philly
Our Jewish Studies program implements a broad and multidisciplinary liberal arts approach to the study of Jewish people, Jewishness and Judaism. The Department of Religion is our home, and our faculty deals with the study of Judaism and religion as a whole as an academic discipline. We were the first university to offer a Certificate in Secular Jewish Studies. You do not need a particular religious background to study with us, as part of a major secular public university, our courses and programs are open to students of all backgrounds. Classes cover both biblical and modern aspects of Jewish Studies, from the Dead Sea Scrolls to modern Jewish filmmakers and comedians in America.  

### _This program is not presently accepting new students._
