The Feinstein Center also publishes books and articles.

## Association for Jewish Studies
The Association for Jewish Studies (AJS) was founded in 1969 by a small group of scholars seeking a forum to explore methodological and pedagogical issues in the new field of Jewish Studies. Since its founding, the AJS has grown into the largest learned society and professional organization representing Jewish Studies scholars worldwide. Temple faculty serve on the board of directors and participate in the annual conferences.
