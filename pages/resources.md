## Association for Jewish Studies
The Association for Jewish Studies (AJS) was founded in 1969 by a small group of scholars seeking a forum to explore methodological and pedagogical issues in the new field of Jewish Studies. Since its founding, the AJS has grown into the largest learned society and professional organization representing Jewish Studies scholars worldwide. Temple faculty serve on the board of directors and participate in the annual conferences.

## Journal of Ecumenical Studies 
The Department of Religion at Temple University houses and edits the _Journal of Ecumenical Studies_ (J.E.S.), the premier journal in inter-religious conversation. Co-founded and edited by Leonard Swidler in 1964, a professor of Catholic Thought and Interreligious Dialogue at Temple, J.E.S is the first peer-reviewed publication in our discipline. Published initially as an intra-Christian endeavor, it quickly evolved to include Christian-Jewish dialogue. Eventually the journal expanded to include all the worldâ€™s major religions and ideologies, including atheism.  

## The Dialogue Institute
The Dialogue Institute (DI), based at Temple University, is associated with the _Journal of Ecumenical Studies_. The DI leads and sustains a movement of inter-religious and inter-cultural dialogue within an academic setting and on a global scale. In partnership with Temple University's Department of Religion, the DI offers graduate courses, independent study and opportunities to contribute original research toward interfaith dialogue. For more information contact the [Dialogue Institute office](mailto:info@dialogueinstitute.org).
