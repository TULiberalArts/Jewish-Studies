  expertise: "Political Theory, Democratic Theory, Participatory Democracy and Political Empowerment, Theories of Justice, Theory and Ideology, Politics and Religion, Comparative Historiography of Western Political Theory and Western Religion, Epistemology, Ethics, and Politics"
  bio: >
    My recent work has been devoted to a systematic calling into question of a pervasive set of dichotomies constitutive of Western  self-understanding. These dichotomies have been rationality/power,  truth/skepticism, belief/non-belief, religion/politics, infinity/finiteness. In a series of books and essays which is  continuing into the present, I have tried to theorize the ways in which the second-listed foil in each of these dichotomies partakes of many key characteristics of the term that it is officially serving as a  contrast to. “Power” is a rationally devised category to help flag the limitations of reason. Skepticism in its denials and renunciations is a theory of truth in its own right. The non-believer in any given set  of beliefs is simultaneously guided by another set of beliefs and  priorities that he might not be fully self-conscious about. Given the  fundamental premise of Western monotheistic religion that God is utterly transcendent and infinite, then religion from its formative period  through all subsequent generations consists of a series of power  assertions invoked to advance its principles and values. The very label of “infinite” applied to God delimits Him and militates against its  own content unless you translate vertical infinity into horizontal  terms, envisioning stretches of human time moving endlessly forward. The conceptual confusions residing in these dichotomies are reflected  and re-inscribed in theoretical and historical texts and the  interpretations they have spawned. In my own work, I have focused on  ancient, medieval, early modern, and late modern texts to try and get  hold of the thread at the right end and achieve enhanced coherence.

    Laura Levitt is a Professor of Religion, Jewish Studies and Gender at Temple University where she has chaired the department of Religion and served as director of both the Women’s Studies and the Jewish Studies Programs. She is the author of American Jewish Loss after the Holocaust (2007) and Jews and Feminism: The Ambivalent Search for Home (1997). She is an editor of Judaism Since Gender (1997) and Impossible Images: Contemporary Art after the Holocaust (2003). Her current project, “Evidence as Archive” builds on her prior work in feminist theory and Holocaust studies to ask what material evidence held in police storage can teach us about the role of all those other objects collected in the Holocaust museums, libraries, and archives. This project is a meditation on what it means to do justice to traumatic legacies through an engagement with such objects.

  expertise: "Modern Germany, Military History, Film, World War One"
  bio: >
    I am interested in the intersection between social and military history and especially in the social and cultural impact of warfare in Europe. I have worked on a wide-range of subjects, from German political culture and national identity, to POW and veterans’ affairs, to the role of film in illuminating historical consciousness. I am completing a book on the military career and anti-Semitic politics of Erich Ludendorff. I offer courses on European social, military, and film history. I can prepare graduate students in both German social and military history, or provide guidance to those interested in Europe as a primary or comparative field. I especially enjoy teaching comparative courses which seek to understand the way in which modern societies organize for and are transformed by war.

He is also thinking and writing about Jews and anti-racism, Palestinians and African-American culture, moral exercises that religions use to create saintly peo ple, the intellectual influences on Martin Luther King, and the dynamics of political and religious conversions. Outside of the classroom, he performs in story slams, does stand up comedy, and is an emeritus member of Princeton’s breakdancing crew Sympoh. Ratzman is politically active with Partners in Health–a global health justice movement, Jobs With Justice, and efforts for Middle East peace between Jews and Palestinians.
